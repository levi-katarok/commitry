First, I recognize that this is a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.

Next, I identify the coefficients: a = 1, b = 5, and c = 6.

Then, I apply the quadratic formula, which is x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a).

After calculating the discriminant (D = b² - 4ac), which in this case is positive, indicating two real roots.

Finally, I substitute the values into the formula to find the solutions for x.

To solve the quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0
\]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the coefficients:**
   
   The given equation is in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where:
   - \( a = 1 \)
   - \( b = 5 \)
   - \( c = 6 \)

2. **Quadratic Formula:**

   The solutions for a quadratic equation are given by:

   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Discriminant (\( D \)):**
   
   The discriminant determines the nature of the roots:
   
   \[
   D = b^2 - 4ac
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:

   \[
   D = (5)^2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1
   \]

4. **Find the Roots:**
   
   Substitute \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 6 \) into the quadratic formula:

   \[
   x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2(1)} = \frac{-5 \pm 1}{2}
   \]

   This gives two solutions:

   - For the positive square root:
     \[
     x = \frac{-5 + 1}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
     \]
   
   - For the negative square root:
     \[
     x = \frac{-5 - 1}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3
     \]

5. **Final Solutions:**

   The roots of the equation are:

   \[
   x = -2 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -3
   \]

**Answer:**

\[
\boxed{x = -2 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -3}
\]
